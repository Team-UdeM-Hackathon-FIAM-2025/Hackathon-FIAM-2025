    "  `src/text_processing/text_dataset/`\n",
    "- Merges them into a single Polars DataFrame\n",
    "- Adds a `year` column for reference\n",
    "- Sanity check: validates row counts after concatenation\n",
    "- Exports the final dataset into one file:  \n",
    "  `text_dataset.parquet` (⚠️ ~5 minutes to write)\n",
    "- Optional cleanup: deletes the dataset from memory once exported  \n",

    "- `start_date` = **2005**  \n",
    "- `end_date` = **2025**  \n",
    "- `delete_after = True` → free RAM after export  \n",

      "(datetime.date(2006, 2, 9), 827054, '10Q', 'Item\\n 1A. Risk Factors \\n\\n28 Item 1A. Risk\\nFactors \\n\\nWhen\\nevaluating Microchip and its business, you should give careful consideration to\\nthe factors listed below, in addition to the information provided elsewhere in\\nthis Form 10-Q and in other documents that we file with the Securities and\\nExchange Commission. \\n\\n28 \\n\\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate due to factors that could\\nreduce our net sales and profitability . \\n\\nOur quarterly operating results are affected by a\\nwide variety of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability, many\\nof which are beyond our control. Some of\\nthe factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include: \\n\\nchanges in demand or market acceptance of our\\nproducts and products of our customers \\n\\n the mix of inventory we hold and our ability to\\nsatisfy orders from our inventory \\n\\n levels of inventories at our customers \\n\\n changes in utilization of our manufacturing\\ncapacity and fluctuations in manufacturing yields \\n\\n our ability to secure sufficient assembly and\\ntesting capacity \\n\\n competitive developments including pricing\\npressures \\n\\n the level of orders that are received and can\\nbe shipped in a quarter \\n\\n the level of sell-through of our products\\nthrough distribution \\n\\n changes or fluctuations in customer order\\npatterns and seasonality \\n\\n constrained availability from other\\nelectronic suppliers impacting our customers ability to ship their products,\\nwhich in turn may adversely impact our sales to those customers \\n\\n costs and outcomes of any pending or future\\ntax audits or any litigation involving intellectual property, customers or\\nother issues \\n\\n disruptions in our business, our vendors \\nbusinesses or our customers businesses due to terrorist activity, armed\\nconflict, war, natural disasters, worldwide oil prices and supply, public\\nhealth concerns or disruptions in the transportation system \\n\\n property damage or other losses which are not\\ncovered by insurance, and \\n\\n general economic, industry or political\\nconditions in the United States or internationally. \\n\\nWe believe that period-to-period comparisons of our\\noperating results are not necessarily meaningful and that you should not rely\\nupon any such comparisons as indications of future performance. In future periods our operating results may\\nfall below our public guidance or the expectations of public market analysts\\nand investors, which would likely have a negative effect on the price of our\\ncommon stock. \\n\\nRecent regulations related to equity compensation could adversely\\naffect our earnings and our ability to attract and retain key personnel. \\n\\nSince our inception, we have used stock options and\\nother long-term equity incentives as a fundamental component of our employee\\ncompensation packages and have accounted for them using the intrinsic value\\nmethod of APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. We believe that stock options and other\\nlong-term equity incentives directly motivate our employees to maximize\\nlong-term stockholder value and, through the use of vesting, encourage\\nemployees to remain with Microchip. In December 2004,\\nthe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial\\nAccounting Standards No. 123 (SFAS 123) (revised 2004), Share-Based\\nPayments (SFAS 123R), which changed U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting\\nPrinciples in such a way to require us to record a charge to earnings for the\\nfair value of employee stock option grants and other share based compensation\\nbeginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. \\nThis regulation will negatively impact our earnings for those share\\nbased awards that vest beginning in fiscal 2007. For example, recording a charge for employee\\nstock options under SFAS 123 would have decreased our net income by\\n 37.2 million in fiscal 2005 and by 12.8 million in the first nine months\\nof fiscal 2006. The impact on net income\\nof SFAS 123R may differ significantly than the impact as calculated under SFAS\\n123. Furthermore, adoption of SFAS 123R\\nwill require us to make certain assumptions and judgments in the valuation of\\nstock options that we may grant in the future. \\nA change in any of those assumptions or judgments could change the\\ncompensation expense that is charged against our earnings and, consequently,\\nadversely affect our results of operations. \\nSee also Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements \\nShare-Based Payment. \\n\\nIn addition, regulations implemented by NASDAQ\\nrequiring shareholder approval for all stock option plans as well as\\nregulations implemented by the New York Stock Exchange prohibiting NYSE member\\norganizations from giving a proxy to vote on equity-compensation plans unless\\nthe beneficial owner of the shares has given voting instructions could make it\\nmore difficult for us to grant equity-based awards to employees in the \\n\\n29 \\n\\nfuture. To the extent that these or other new\\nregulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant options to employees,\\nwe may incur compensation costs, productivity losses, change our equity\\ncompensation strategy or find it difficult to attract, retain and motivate\\nemployees, each of which could materially and adversely affect our business. \\n\\nOur operating results will suffer if we ineffectively utilize our\\nmanufacturing capacity or fail to maintain manufacturing yields. \\n\\nThe manufacture and assembly of integrated circuits,\\nparticularly non-volatile, erasable CMOS memory and logic devices such as those\\nthat we produce, are complex processes. \\nThese processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors, including\\nthe level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment, impurities in the\\nmaterials used and the performance of our wafer fabrication personnel and\\nequipment. As is typical in the\\nsemiconductor industry, we have from time to time experienced lower than\\nanticipated manufacturing yields. Our\\noperating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at\\napproximately the current levels. \\n\\nOur operating results are also adversely affected\\nwhen we operate at less than optimal capacity. \\nLower capacity utilization results in certain costs being charged\\ndirectly to expense and lower gross margins. \\n\\nWe are dependent on orders that are received and shipped in the same\\nquarter and therefore limited in our visibility of future product shipments. \\n\\nOur net sales in any given quarter depend upon a\\ncombination of shipments from backlog and orders received in that quarter for\\nshipment in that quarter, which we refer to as turns orders. Historically, we have proven our ability to\\nrespond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy,\\nresulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery\\nschedules. Shorter lead times generally\\nmean that turns orders as a percentage of our business are relatively high in\\nany particular quarter and reduces our backlog visibility on future product\\nshipments. Turns orders correlate to\\noverall semiconductor industry conditions and product lead times. Because turns orders are difficult to\\npredict, varying levels of turns orders make our net sales more difficult to\\nforecast. If we do not achieve a\\nsufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter relative to our\\nrevenue targets, our revenue and operating results may suffer. \\n\\nIntense competition in the markets we serve may lead to pricing\\npressures, reduced sales of our products or reduced market share. \\n\\nThe semiconductor industry is intensely competitive\\nand has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological\\nchange. We compete with major domestic\\nand international semiconductor companies, many of which have greater market\\nrecognition and substantially greater financial, technical, marketing,\\ndistribution and other resources than we do with which to pursue engineering,\\nmanufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products. We may be unable to compete successfully in\\nthe future, which could harm our business. \\n\\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on a\\nnumber of factors both within and outside our control, including: \\n\\nthe quality, performance, reliability,\\nfeatures, ease of use, pricing and diversity of our products \\n\\n our success in designing and manufacturing\\nnew products including those implementing new technologies \\n\\n the rate at which customers incorporate our\\nproducts into their own applications \\n\\n product introductions by our competitors \\n\\n the number, nature and success of our\\ncompetitors in a given market \\n\\n our ability to obtain adequate supplies of\\nraw materials and other supplies at acceptable prices \\n\\n our ability to protect our products and\\nprocesses by effective utilization of intellectual property rights \\n\\n the quality of our customer service and our\\nability to address the needs of our customers, and \\n\\n general market and economic conditions. \\n\\n30 \\n\\nHistorically, average selling prices in the\\nsemiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product. The overall average selling prices of our\\nmicrocontroller and proprietary analog and interface products have remained\\nrelatively constant, while average selling prices of our Serial EEPROM and non-proprietary\\nanalog and interface products have declined over time. \\n\\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to\\nexperience, modest pricing declines in certain of our more mature proprietary\\nproduct lines, due primarily to competitive conditions. We have been able to moderate average selling\\nprice declines in many of our proprietary product lines by continuing to\\nintroduce new products with more features and higher prices. We have experienced in the past and expect to\\ncontinue to experience in the future varying degrees of competitive pricing\\npressures in our Serial EEPROM products. \\n\\nWe may be unable to maintain average selling prices\\nfor our products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future, which\\ncould adversely impact our operating results. \\n\\nOur business is highly dependent on selling through distributors. \\n\\nSales through distributors accounted for\\napproximately 65 of our net sales in fiscal 2005 and approximately 64 for the\\nfirst nine months of fiscal 2006. Our\\ntwo largest distributors together accounted for approximately 25 of our net\\nsales in fiscal 2005 and approximately 24 of our net sales in the first nine\\nmonths of fiscal 2006. We do not have\\nlong-term agreements with our distributors and our distributors may terminate\\ntheir relationships with us with little or no advanced notice. \\n\\nThe loss of, or a disruption in the operations of,\\none or more of our distributors could reduce our net sales in a given quarter\\nand could result in an increase in inventory returns. \\n\\nOur success depends on our ability to introduce new products on a\\ntimely basis. \\n\\nOur future operating results will depend on our\\nability to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis that can\\ncompete effectively on the basis of price and performance and which address\\ncustomer requirements. The success of\\nour new product introductions depends on various factors, including: \\n\\nproper new product selection \\n\\n timely completion and introduction of new\\nproduct designs \\n\\n development of support tools and collateral\\nliterature that make complex new products easy for engineers to understand and\\nuse, and \\n\\n market acceptance of our customers end\\nproducts. \\n\\nBecause our products are complex, we have\\nexperienced delays from time to time in completing development of new\\nproducts. In addition, our new products\\nmay not receive or maintain substantial market acceptance. We may be unable to design, develop and\\nintroduce competitive products on a timely basis, which could adversely impact\\nour future operating results. \\n\\nOur success also depends upon our ability to develop\\nand implement new design and process technologies. Semiconductor design and process technologies\\nare subject to rapid technological change and require significant R D\\nexpenditures. We and other companies in\\nthe industry have, from time to time, experienced difficulties in effecting\\ntransitions to advanced process technologies and, consequently, have suffered\\nreduced manufacturing yields or delays in product deliveries. Our future operating results could be adversely\\naffected if any transition to future process technologies is substantially\\ndelayed or inefficiently implemented. \\n\\nWe must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful, and\\ncompetition for qualified personnel is intense in our market. \\n\\n31 \\n\\nOur success depends upon the efforts and abilities\\nof our senior management, engineering and other personnel. The competition for qualified engineering and\\nmanagement personnel is intense. We may\\nbe unsuccessful in retaining our existing key personnel or in attracting and\\nretaining additional key personnel that we require. The loss of the services of one or more of\\nour key personnel or the inability to add key personnel could harm our\\nbusiness. We have no employment\\nagreements with any member of our senior management team. \\n\\nWe are dependent on several third-party contractors to perform key\\nmanufacturing functions for us. \\n\\nWe use several third-party contractors located in\\nAsia for a portion of the assembly and testing of our products. We also rely on outside wafer foundries for a\\nportion of our wafer fabrication. \\nAlthough we own the majority of our manufacturing resources, the\\ndisruption or termination of any of our third-party contractors could harm our\\nbusiness and operating results. \\n\\nOur use of third parties involves some reduction in\\nour level of control over the portions of our business that we\\nsubcontract. Our future operating\\nresults could suffer if any third-party contractor were to experience financial,\\noperations or production difficulties or situations when demand exceeds\\ncapacity, or if they were unable to maintain manufacturing yields, assembly and\\ntest yields and costs at approximately their current levels, or if due to their\\nlocations in foreign countries they were to experience political upheaval or\\ninfrastructure disruption. In such case,\\nwe may not be able to qualify additional manufacturing sources for our products\\nin a timely manner or at all, and such arrangements, if any, may not be on favorable\\nterms to us. In such event, our business\\nand operating results could be adversely affected. \\n\\nWe may lose sales if our suppliers of raw materials and equipment fail\\nto meet our needs. \\n\\nOur semiconductor manufacturing operations require\\nraw materials and equipment that must meet exacting standards. We generally have more than one source for\\nthese supplies, but there are only a limited number of suppliers capable of\\ndelivering various raw materials and equipment that meet our standards. The raw materials and equipment necessary for\\nour business could become more difficult to obtain as worldwide use of\\nsemiconductors in product applications increases. We have experienced supply shortages from\\ntime to time in the past, and on occasion our suppliers have told us they need\\nmore time than expected to fill our orders or that they will no longer support\\ncertain equipment with updates or spare and replacements parts. An interruption of any raw materials or\\nequipment sources, or the lack of supplier support for a particular piece of\\nequipment, could harm our business. \\n\\nOur operating results may be impacted by the wide fluctuations of\\nsupply and demand in the semiconductor industry. \\n\\nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by wide\\nfluctuations of supply and demand. The\\nindustry has experienced significant economic downturns, characterized by\\ndiminished product demand and production over-capacity. We have sought to reduce our exposure to this\\nindustry cyclicality by selling proprietary products that cannot be easily or\\nquickly replaced, to a geographically diverse base of customers across a broad\\nrange of market segments. However, we\\nhave experienced substantial period-to-period fluctuations in operating results\\nand expect, in the future, to experience period-to-period fluctuations in\\noperating results due to general industry or economic conditions. \\n\\nWe are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims. \\n\\nWe\\nhave in the past, are currently, and in the future may be, involved in legal\\nproceedings or claims regarding patent infringement, intellectual property\\nrights, contracts or other matters. As\\nis typical in the semiconductor industry, from time to time, we may receive\\nletters from various industry participants alleging infringement of patents or\\ntrade secrets. We typically respond when\\nappropriate and as advised by legal counsel. \\nAny lawsuits resulting from such allegations could subject us to\\nsignificant liability for damages and invalidate our proprietary rights. We also receive notifications from customers\\nfrom time to time who believe that we owe them indemnification or other\\nobligations related to infringement claims made against the customers by third\\nparties. These legal proceedings and\\nclaims, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial cost to us \\n\\n32 \\n\\nand divert our\\nresources. If we are not able to resolve\\na claim, negotiate a settlement of a matter, obtain necessary licenses on\\ncommercially reasonable terms, and/or successfully prosecute or defend our position,\\nwe could incur uninsured liability in any one of them and our business,\\nfinancial condition or results of operations could be harmed. \\n\\nIt is also possible that from time to time we may be\\nsubject to warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant\\nexpenses related to the defense of such claims or any requirement to pay\\ndamages claims. We do have product\\nliability insurance, but there is no certainty that insurance will cover all\\nclaims or be of a sufficient amount to fully protect against such claims. Costs or payments we may make in connection\\nwith warranty or product liability claims may adversely affect the results of\\nour operations. \\n\\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property could result in\\nlost revenue or market opportunities. \\n\\nOur ability to obtain patents, licenses and other\\nintellectual property rights covering our products and manufacturing processes\\nis important for our success. To that\\nend, we have acquired certain patents and patent licenses and intend to\\ncontinue to seek patents on our inventions and manufacturing processes. The process of seeking patent protection can\\nbe long and expensive, and patents may not be issued from currently pending or\\nfuture applications. In addition, our\\nexisting patents and any new patents that are issued may not be of sufficient\\nscope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage\\nto us. We may be subject to or may\\ninitiate interference proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which\\ncan require significant financial and management resources. In addition, the laws of certain foreign\\ncountries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as\\nthe laws of the United States. \\nInfringement of our intellectual property rights by a third party could\\nresult in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for us. \\n\\nWe do not have long-term contracts with our customers . \\n\\nWe do not typically enter into long-term contracts\\nwith our customers and we cannot be certain about future order levels from our\\ncustomers. When we do enter into\\ncustomer contracts, the contract is generally cancelable at the convenience of\\nthe customer. In the event of any early\\ntermination of a contract by one of our major customers, it is unlikely that we\\nwould be able to rapidly replace that revenue source which could harm our\\nfinancial results. \\n\\nBusiness interruptions could harm our business. \\n\\nOperations at any of our manufacturing facilities,\\nor at any of our wafer fabrication or test and assembly subcontractors, may be\\ndisrupted for reasons beyond our control, including work stoppages, power loss,\\nincidents of terrorism or security risk, political instability, public health\\nissues, telecommunications, transportation or other infrastructure failure,\\nfire, earthquake, floods, or other natural disasters. If operations at any of our facilities, or\\nour subcontractors facilities are interrupted, we may not be able to shift\\nproduction to other facilities on a timely basis. If this occurs, we would likely experience\\ndelays in shipments of products to our customers and alternate sources for\\nproduction may be unavailable on acceptable terms. This could result in reduced revenues and\\nprofits and the cancellation of orders or loss of customers. In addition, business interruption insurance\\nwill likely not be enough to compensate us for any losses that may occur and\\nany losses or damages incurred by us as a result of business interruptions\\ncould significantly harm our business. \\n\\nWe are highly dependent on foreign sales and operations, which exposes\\nus to foreign political and economic risks. \\n\\nSales to foreign customers account for a substantial\\nportion of our net sales. During fiscal\\n2005 and the first nine months of fiscal 2006, approximately 73 of our net\\nsales were made to foreign customers. We\\npurchase a substantial portion of our raw materials and equipment from foreign\\nsuppliers. In addition, we own product\\nassembly and testing facilities located near Bangkok, Thailand. We also use various foreign third-party\\ncontractors for a portion of our assembly and testing and for a portion of our\\nwafer fabrication requirements. \\nSubstantially all of our finished goods inventory is maintained in\\nThailand. \\n\\n33 \\n\\nOur reliance on foreign operations, foreign\\nsuppliers, maintenance of substantially all of our finished goods in inventory\\nat foreign locations and significant foreign sales exposes us to foreign\\npolitical and economic risks, including: \\n\\npolitical, social and economic instability \\n\\n trade restrictions and changes in tariffs \\n\\n import and export license requirements and\\nrestrictions \\n\\n difficulties in staffing and managing\\ninternational operations \\n\\n employment regulations \\n\\n disruptions in international transport or\\ndelivery \\n\\n fluctuations in currency exchange rates \\n\\n difficulties in collecting receivables \\n\\n public health conditions \\n\\n economic slowdown in the worldwide markets\\nserved by us, and \\n\\n potentially adverse tax consequences. \\n\\nIf any of these risks materialize, our sales could\\ndecrease and our operating results could suffer. \\n\\nWe are subject to stringent environmental regulations, which may force\\nus to incur significant expenses. \\n\\nWe must comply with many different federal, state\\nand local governmental regulations related to the use, storage, discharge and\\ndisposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our\\nmanufacturing process. Although we\\nbelieve that our activities conform to presently applicable environmental\\nregulations, our failure to comply with present or future regulations could\\nresult in the imposition of fines, suspension of production or a cessation of\\noperations. Any such environmental\\nregulations could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other\\nsignificant expenses to comply with such regulations. Any failure by us to control the use of or\\nadequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances could subject us to\\nfuture liabilities. Environmental\\nproblems may occur that could subject us to future costs or liabilities. \\n\\nFurther, certain of our customers shipping their\\nproducts into European markets are also subject to governmental environmental\\nregulations such as the Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and\\nElectronic Equipment Directive (RoHS) which will be effective July 1,\\n2006, and the Directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment. These directives focus on limiting the\\namounts of certain elements, such as lead, in electrical devices, and providing\\nfor the proper disposal of the electrical devices and their components. The inability of this sub-set of our\\ncustomers to use Microchip products which contain lead after July 2006 may\\nadversely affect our results of operations. \\n\\nChanges in securities laws and\\nrelated regulations in recent years have resulted in increased costs to us. \\n\\nChanges in the laws and regulations affecting public\\ncompanies, including the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules enacted\\nin recent years by the SEC, NASDAQ and the NYSE, have resulted in significantly\\nincreased costs to us as we respond to their requirements. In particular, complying with the internal\\ncontrol audit requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 has resulted in\\nincreased internal efforts and significantly higher fees from our independent\\naccounting firm. \\n\\nOur fiscal 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K\\ncontained a report by our management on our internal control over financial\\nreporting including an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control\\nover financial reporting as of March 31, 2005. Our fiscal 2005 Form 10-K also contained\\nan attestation and report by our auditors with respect to our management s\\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting\\nunder Section 404. While these\\nassessments and reports did not reveal any material weaknesses in our internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting, compliance with Section 404 is an\\nongoing process and will be required for each future fiscal year. We expect that the ongoing compliance with Section 404\\nwill continue to be both very costly and very challenging and there can be no\\nassurance that material weaknesses will be identified in future \\n\\n34 \\n\\nperiods. Any adverse results from such ongoing compliance\\nefforts could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports\\nand have an adverse effect on our stock price. \\n\\nThe future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide\\nfluctuations in response to a variety of factors. \\n\\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated\\nsignificantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future. The future trading price of our common stock\\ncould be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, many\\nof which are beyond our control, including: \\n\\nquarterly variations in our operating results\\nand the operating results of other technology companies \\n\\n actual or anticipated announcements of\\ntechnical innovations or new products by us or our competitors \\n\\n changes in analysts estimates of our\\nfinancial performance or buy/sell recommendations \\n\\n changes in our financial guidance or our\\nfailure to meet such guidance \\n\\n general conditions in the semiconductor\\nindustry, and \\n\\n worldwide economic and financial conditions. \\n\\nIn addition, the stock market has experienced\\nsignificant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the\\nmarket prices for many high technology companies and that often have been\\nunrelated to the operating performance of such companies. These broad market fluctuations and other\\nfactors may harm the market price of our common stock.', 'Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of\\n Financial Condition and Results of Operations \\n\\n12 Item 2. Management s Discussion and\\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \\n\\nOur Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\\nResults of Operations contains certain forward-looking statements that involve\\nrisks and uncertainties, including statements regarding our strategy, financial\\nperformance and revenue sources. We use\\nwords such as anticipate, believe, plan, expect, future, intend and\\nsimilar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially\\nfrom the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of\\ncertain factors including those set forth below and under Risk Factors, \\nbeginning at page 28 . Although we\\nbelieve that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are\\nreasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance\\nor achievements. You should not place\\nundue reliance on these forward-looking statements. We disclaim any obligation to update information\\ncontained in any forward-looking statement. \\n\\n12 \\n\\nWe begin our Management s\\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\\n(MD A) with a summary of Microchip s overall business strategy to give the\\nreader an overview of the goals of our business and the overall direction of\\nour business and products. This is\\nfollowed by a discussion of the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates that\\nwe believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments\\nincorporated in our reported financial results. \\nWe then discuss our Results of Operations for the three and nine months\\nended December 31, 2005 compared to the three and nine months ended December 31,\\n2004. We then provide an analysis of\\nchanges in our balance sheet and cash flows, and discuss our financial\\ncommitments in sections titled Liquidity and Capital Resources, Contractual\\nObligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. \\n\\nStrategy \\n\\nOur goal is to be a worldwide leader in providing\\nspecialized semiconductor products for a wide variety of embedded control\\napplications. Our strategic focus is on\\nembedded control products, which include microcontrollers, high-performance\\nlinear and mixed signal devices, power management and thermal management\\ndevices, and complementary microperipheral products including interface\\ndevices, Serial EEPROMs, and our patented KEELOQ security devices. We provide highly cost-effective embedded\\ncontrol products that also offer the advantages of small size, high\\nperformance, low voltage/low power operation and ease of development, enabling\\ntimely and cost-effective embedded control product integration by our\\ncustomers. \\n\\nOur manufacturing operations include wafer\\nfabrication and assembly and test. The\\nownership of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our\\nbusiness strategy, enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing\\ncontrol resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded\\ncontrol industry. By owning our wafer\\nfabrication facilities and much of our assembly and test operations, and by\\nemploying statistical process control techniques, we have been able to achieve\\nand maintain high production yields. Direct\\ncontrol over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and\\nproduction cycles. This control also\\nallows us to capture the wafer manufacturing and a portion of the assembly and\\ntest profit margin. \\n\\nWe employ proprietary design and manufacturing\\nprocesses in developing our embedded control products. We believe our processes afford us both\\ncost-effective designs in existing and derivative products and greater\\nfunctionality in new product designs. While\\nmany of our competitors develop and optimize separate processes for their logic\\nand memory product lines, we use a common process technology for both\\nmicrocontroller and non-volatile memory products. This allows us to more fully leverage our\\nprocess research and development costs and to deliver new products to market\\nmore rapidly. Our engineers utilize\\nadvanced computer-aided design (CAD) tools and software to perform circuit\\ndesign, simulation and layout, and our in-house photomask and wafer fabrication\\nfacilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test wafers\\nquickly and efficiently. \\n\\nWe are committed to continuing our investment in new\\nand enhanced products, including development systems, and in our design and\\nmanufacturing process technologies. We\\nbelieve these investments are significant factors in maintaining our\\ncompetitive position. Our current\\nresearch and development activities focus on the design of new\\nmicrocontrollers, digital signal controllers, ASSPs, memory and mixed-signal\\nproducts, new development systems, software and application-specific software\\nlibraries. We are also developing new\\ndesign and process technologies to achieve further cost reductions and\\nperformance improvements in existing products. \\n\\nWe market our products worldwide primarily through a\\nnetwork of direct sales personnel and distributors. Our distributors focus primarily on servicing\\nthe product and technical support requirements of a broad base of diverse\\ncustomers. We believe that distributors\\nprovide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base. Our direct sales force focuses primarily on\\nmajor strategic accounts in three geographical markets: the Americas, Europe\\nand Asia. We currently maintain sales\\nand support centers in major metropolitan areas in North America, Europe and\\nAsia. We believe that a strong technical\\nservice presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded\\ncontrol market. Many of our field sales\\nengineers (FSEs), field application engineers (FAEs), and sales management have\\ntechnical degrees and have been previously employed in an engineering\\nenvironment. We believe that the\\ntechnical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive \\n\\n13 \\n\\nadvantage\\nin the sale of our products. The primary\\nmission of our FAE team is to provide technical assistance to strategic\\naccounts and to conduct periodic training sessions for FSEs and distributor\\nsales teams. FAEs also frequently\\nconduct technical seminars in major cities around the world, and work closely\\nwith our distributors to provide technical assistance and end-user support. \\n\\nCritical Accounting\\nPolicies and Estimates \\n\\nGeneral \\n\\nOur discussion and analysis of Microchip s financial\\ncondition and results of operations is based upon our Condensed Consolidated\\nFinancial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting\\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America. We review the accounting policies we use in\\nreporting our financial results on a regular basis. The preparation of these financial statements\\nrequires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of\\nassets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent\\nliabilities. On an ongoing basis, we\\nevaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition,\\ninventories, income taxes, property plant and equipment, impairment of\\nproperty, plant and equipment and litigation. \\nWe base our estimates on historical experience and on various other\\nassumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the\\nresults of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value\\nof assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Results may differ from these estimates due\\nto actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions. We review these estimates and judgments on an\\nongoing basis. We believe the following\\ncritical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and\\nestimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We also have other policies that we consider\\nkey accounting policies, such as our policy regarding revenue recognition to\\nOEMs; however, we do not believe these policies require us to make estimates or\\njudgments that are as difficult or subjective as our policies described below. \\n\\nRevenue\\nRecognition Distributors \\n\\nOur distributors worldwide have broad rights to\\nreturn products and price protection, so we defer revenue recognition until the\\ndistributor sells the product to their customers. We reduce product pricing through price\\nprotection based on market conditions, competitive considerations and other\\nfactors. Price protection is granted to\\ndistributors on the inventory that they have on hand at the date the price protection\\nis offered. When we reduce the price of\\nour products, it allows the distributor to claim a credit against its\\noutstanding accounts receivable balances based on the new price of the\\ninventory it has on hand as of the date of the price reduction. There is no revenue impact from the price\\nprotection. We also grant certain\\ncredits to our distributors. The credits\\nare granted to the distributors on specially identified pieces of the\\ndistributors business to allow them to earn a competitive gross margin on the\\nsale of our products to their end customers. \\nThe credits are on a per unit basis and are not given to the distributor\\nuntil they provide documentation of the sale to their end customer. The effect of granting these credits\\nestablishes the net selling price from us to our distributors for the product\\nand results in the net revenue recognized by us when the product is sold by the\\ndistributors to their end customers. Upon\\nshipment, amounts billed to distributors are included as accounts receivable,\\ninventory is relieved, and the sale and the gross margin are deferred and are\\nreflected as a current liability until the product is sold by the distributor\\nto their customers. \\n\\nInventories \\n\\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or\\nmarket using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. We write down our inventory for estimated\\nobsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference\\nbetween the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon\\nassumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less\\nfavorable than those we projected, additional inventory write-downs may be\\nrequired. Inventory impairment charges\\nestablish a new cost basis for inventory and charges are not subsequently reversed\\nto income even if circumstances later suggest that increased carrying amounts\\nare recoverable. In estimating our\\nreserves for obsolescence, we primarily evaluate estimates of demand over a 12-month\\nperiod and provide reserves for inventory on hand in excess of the estimated 12-month\\ndemand. \\n\\n14 \\n\\nIncome Taxes \\n\\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated\\nfinancial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of\\nthe jurisdictions in which we operate. This\\nprocess involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with\\nassessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for\\ntax and accounting purposes. These\\ndifferences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included\\nwithin our consolidated balance sheet. We\\nmust then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered\\nfrom future taxable income within the relevant jurisdiction and to the extent\\nwe believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. We have not provided for a valuation\\nallowance because we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred\\ntax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. Should we determine that we would not be able\\nto realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an\\nadjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period\\nsuch determination was made. At December 31,\\n2005, our gross deferred tax asset was 62.7 million. \\n\\nVarious taxing authorities in the United States and\\nother countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of\\nvarious tax structures employed by businesses. \\nCompanies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing\\nauthorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations. We are currently under audit by the United\\nStates Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for our fiscal years ended March 31,\\n1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001. As part of this\\nongoing audit, the IRS has proposed certain adjustments related to positions\\nreflected on these returns. The IRS has\\nissued formal assessments for these adjustments. We do not agree with these adjustments and are\\nappealing these assessments. We recognize\\nliabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax\\njurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which,\\nadditional tax payments are probable. We\\nbelieve that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax\\nliabilities that may arise upon final resolution of the pending audit through\\neither settlement or the appeals process with the IRS. The IRS recently began an audit of our fiscal\\nyears ended March 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004. \\nWe believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset any\\npotential tax liabilities that may arise upon these and other audits in the\\nUnited States and other countries in which we do business. If such amounts ultimately prove to be\\nunnecessary, the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax\\nbenefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed\\nnecessary. If such amounts ultimately\\nprove to be less than an ultimate assessment, a future charge to expense would\\nbe recorded in the period in which the assessment is determined. \\n\\nThe foregoing statements regarding the recoverability of our deferred\\ntax asset and the adequacy of our tax reserves are forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially\\nbecause of the following factors, among others: results of any current or\\nfuture audit conducted by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other taxing\\nauthorities in the countries in which we do business; the level of our taxable\\nincome and whether our taxable income will be sufficient to realize the\\nbenefits available from our deferred tax assets; current and future tax laws\\nand regulations; and taxation rates in geographic regions where we have\\nsignificant operations. \\n\\nProperty,\\nPlant Equipment \\n\\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Major renewals and improvements are\\ncapitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred. At December 31, 2005, the carrying value\\nof our property and equipment totaled 653.6 million, which represents 32.6 of\\nour total assets. This carrying value\\nreflects the application of our property and equipment accounting policies,\\nwhich incorporate estimates, assumptions and judgments relative to the useful\\nlives of our property and equipment. Depreciation\\nis provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the\\nrelated assets, which range from five to seven years on manufacturing equipment\\nand approximately 30 years on buildings. \\n\\nWe began production activities at Fab 4 on October 31,\\n2003. We began to depreciate the Fab 4 equipment\\nas the assets were placed in service for production purposes. As of December 31, 2005, all of the\\nbuildings and supporting facilities were being depreciated as well as the\\nmanufacturing equipment that had been placed in service. All manufacturing equipment that was not\\nbeing used in production activities was maintained in projects in process and\\nis not being depreciated until it is placed into service since management\\nbelieves there \\n\\n15 \\n\\nis\\nno change to its utility from the present time until it is placed into\\nproductive service. The lives to be used\\nfor depreciating this equipment at Fab 4 will be evaluated at such time as the\\nassets are placed in service. We do not\\nbelieve that the temporary idling of such assets has impaired the estimated\\nlife or carrying values of the underlying assets. \\n\\nOn March 31, 2005, we changed the\\nclassification of Fab 3 from an asset held-for-sale to an asset\\nheld-for-future-use. Fab 3 had been on\\nthe market for over two years, and we had not received any acceptable offers on\\nthe facility. Over that period of time,\\nour business had increased significantly and over the next several years we\\nwill need to begin planning for future wafer fabrication capacity as a larger\\npercentage of Fab 4 s clean room capacity is utilized. We determined that the appropriate action to\\ntake was to stop actively marketing the Fab 3 facility and hold it for our\\nfuture use. As a result of this change\\nin classification, we had to assess the fair value of the Fab 3 asset to\\ndetermine if any additional impairment charge was required upon the change in\\nclassification from held-for-sale to held-for-future-use under Statement of\\nFinancial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 144. We performed a discounted cash flow analysis\\nof the Fab 3 asset based on various financial projections in developing the\\nfair value estimate given that it was the best available valuation technique\\nfor the asset. The discounted cash flow\\nanalysis confirmed the carrying value of the Fab 3 asset at March 31, 2005\\nwas not in excess of its fair value. If\\nindicators of impairment for the Fab 3 assets arise in the future, we will\\ndetermine if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to\\nthe assets in question are less than their carrying value. If less, we would recognize an impairment\\nloss on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective\\nfair values. We began to depreciate the\\nFab 3 assets in April 2005. \\n\\nThe estimates, assumptions and judgments we use in\\nthe application of our property and equipment policies reflect both historical\\nexperience and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations. The use of different estimates,\\nassumptions and judgments regarding the useful lives of our property and\\nequipment and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations,\\nwould likely result in materially different carrying values of assets and\\nresults of operations. \\n\\nWe do not currently hold title to the land on which\\nour Thailand facility resides. The land\\nis subject to a complex restructuring situation relating to the seller of the\\nland. We have provided reserves that we\\nestimate will be adequate to obtain full title. \\nSuch reserves are set at the estimated fair value of the land. However, timing of the resolution is\\ndifficult to predict and the ultimate amount to be paid could change. \\n\\nImpairment of\\nProperty, Plant and Equipment \\n\\nWe assess whether indicators\\nof impairment of long-lived assets are present. \\nIf such indicators are present, we determine whether the sum of the\\nestimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is\\nless than their carrying value. If less,\\nwe recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of\\nthe assets over their respective fair values. \\nFair value is determined by discounted future cash flows, appraisals or\\nother methods. If the assets determined\\nto be impaired are to be held and used, we recognize an impairment loss through\\na charge to our operating results to the extent the present value of\\nanticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset s\\ncarrying value. We depreciate the\\ncarrying value over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset. We may incur impairment losses, or additional\\nlosses on already impaired assets, in future periods if factors influencing our\\nestimates change. \\n\\nLitigation \\n\\nOur current estimated range of liability related to\\ncertain pending litigation is based on the probable loss of claims for which we\\ncan estimate the amount and range of loss. \\nRecorded reserves were not significant at December 31, 2005. \\n\\nBecause of the uncertainties related to both the\\nprobability of loss and the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending\\nlitigation, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that\\ncould result from an unfavorable outcome. \\nAs additional information becomes available, we will assess the\\npotential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates. Revisions in our estimates of the potential\\nliability could materially impact our results of operation and financial\\nposition. \\n\\n16 \\n\\nResults of Operations \\n\\nThe\\nfollowing table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of net\\nsales for the periods indicated: \\n\\nThree Months Ended \\n December 31, \\n\\nNine Months Ended \\n December 31, \\n\\n2005 \\n\\n2004 \\n\\n2005 \\n\\n2004 \\n\\nNet sales \\n\\n100.0 \\n\\n100.0 \\n\\n100.0 \\n\\n100.0 \\n\\nCost of sales \\n\\n40.3 \\n\\n43.1 \\n\\n40.9 \\n\\n42.9 \\n\\nGross profit \\n\\n59.7 \\n\\n56.9 \\n\\n59.1 \\n\\n57.1 \\n\\nResearch and\\n development \\n\\n10.0 \\n\\n11.2 \\n\\n10.3 \\n\\n10.9 \\n\\nSelling, general\\n and administrative \\n\\n13.7 \\n\\n13.7 \\n\\n14.0 \\n\\n13.1 \\n\\nSpecial charge \\n\\n0.0 \\n\\n0.0 \\n\\n0.0 \\n\\n3.3 \\n\\nOperating income \\n\\n36.0 \\n\\n32.0 \\n\\n34.8 \\n\\n29.8 \\n\\nNet Sales \\n\\nWe\\noperate in one industry segment and engage primarily in the design,\\ndevelopment, manufacture and marketing of semiconductor products. We sell our products to distributors and\\noriginal equipment manufacturers, referred to as OEMs, in a broad range of\\nmarket segments, perform on-going credit evaluations of our customers and\\ngenerally require no collateral. \\n\\nOur\\nnet sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 were 234.9 million, an\\nincrease of 3.3 from the previous quarter s sales of 227.3 million, and an\\nincrease of 14.4 from net sales of 205.4 million in the quarter ended December 31,\\n2004. Our net sales for the nine months\\nended December 31, 2005 were 680.7 million, an increase of 6.6 , from net sales of 638.9 million in the nine months\\nended December 31, 2004. The\\nincreases in net sales in these periods resulted primarily from increased\\ndemand across all of our product lines. Average\\nselling prices for our products were down approximately 6 and 4 for the three\\nand nine-month periods ended December 31, 2005 over the corresponding\\nperiods of the previous fiscal year. The\\nnumber of units of our products sold were up approximately 22 and 11 for the\\nthree and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2005 over the\\ncorresponding periods of the previous fiscal year. The average selling prices and the unit\\nvolumes of our sales are impacted by the mix of our products sold. Key factors in achieving the amount of net\\nsales during the three and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2005\\ninclude: \\n\\ncontinued\\nmarket share gains \\n\\n increasing\\nsemiconductor content in our customers products \\n\\n customers \\nincreasing needs for the flexibility offered by our programmable solutions \\n\\n our\\nnew product offerings that have increased our served available market; and \\n\\n increasing\\ndemand for our products. \\n\\nWe\\nrecognize revenue from product sales upon shipment to OEMs. Under our\\nshipping terms, legal title passes to the customer upon shipment from Microchip. We have no post shipment obligations. Distributors generally have broad rights to\\nreturn products and price protection rights, so we defer revenue recognition\\nuntil the distributors sell the product to their customers. Upon shipment, amounts billed to distributors\\nare included in accounts receivable, inventory is relieved, the sale is\\ndeferred and the gross margin is reflected as a current liability until the\\nproduct is sold by the distributors to their customers. \\n\\nSales\\nby product line for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005 and December 31,\\n2004 were as follows (dollars in thousands): \\n\\n17 \\n\\nThree Months Ended \\n December 31, \\n\\nNine Months Ended \\n December 31, \\n\\n(unaudited) \\n\\n(unaudited) \\n\\n2005 \\n\\n2004 \\n\\n2005 \\n\\n2004 \\n\\nMicrocontrollers \\n\\n186,235 \\n\\n79.3 \\n\\n166,061 \\n\\n80.9 \\n\\n540,817 \\n\\n79.4 \\n\\n509,068 \\n\\n79.7 \\n\\nMemory products \\n\\n31,323 \\n\\n13.3 \\n\\n26,902 \\n\\n13.1 \\n\\n93,907 \\n\\n13.8 \\n\\n86,241 \\n\\n13.5 \\n\\nAnalog and\\n interface products \\n\\n17,338 \\n\\n7.4 \\n\\n12,421 \\n\\n6.0 \\n\\n45,997 \\n\\n6.8 \\n\\n43,544 \\n\\n6.8 \\n\\nTotal sales \\n\\n234,896 \\n\\n100.0 \\n\\n205,384 \\n\\n100.0 \\n\\n680,721 \\n\\n100 \\n\\n638,853 \\n\\n100.0 \\n\\nMicrocontrollers \\n\\nOur microcontroller product line represents the largest\\ncomponent of our total net sales. Microcontrollers\\nand associated application development systems accounted for approximately 79.3 \\nof our total net sales for the three-month period ended December 31, 2005 and\\napproximately 79.4 of our total net sales for the nine-month period ended December 31,\\n2005 compared to approximately 80.9 of our total\\nnet sales for the three-month period ended December 31, 2004 and\\napproximately 79.7 of our total net sales for the nine-month period ended December 31,\\n2004. \\n\\nNet\\nsales of our microcontroller products increased approximately 12.1 in the\\nthree-month period ended December 31, 2005 and 6.2 in the nine-month\\nperiod ended December 31, 2005 compared to the three and nine-month periods\\nended December 31, 2004. These sales\\nincreases were primarily due to increased demand for our microcontroller\\nproducts in end markets, driven principally by market share gains and those\\nfactors described on page 17 above. \\nThe end markets that we serve include the automotive, communications,\\ncomputing, consumer and industrial control markets. \\n\\nHistorically, average selling prices in the semiconductor\\nindustry decrease over the life of any particular product. The overall average selling prices of our\\nmicrocontroller products have remained relatively constant over time due to the\\nproprietary nature of these products. We\\nhave experienced, and expect to continue to experience, moderate pricing\\npressure in certain microcontroller product lines, primarily due to competitive\\nconditions. We have been able to in the\\npast, and expect to be able to in the future, to moderate average selling price\\ndeclines in our microcontroller product lines by introducing new products with\\nmore features and higher prices. We may\\nbe unable to maintain average selling prices for our microcontroller products\\nas a result of increased pricing pressure in the future, which would adversely\\naffect our operating results. \\n\\nMemory Products \\n\\nSales of our memory products accounted for approximately 13.3 \\nof our total net sales for the three-month period ended December 31, 2005 and\\n13.8 of our total net sales for the nine-month period ended December 31,\\n2005 compared to approximately 13.1 of our total net sales for the three-month\\nperiod ended December 31, 2004 and approximately 13.5 of our total net\\nsales for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2004. \\n\\nNet sales of our memory products\\nincreased approximately 16.7 in the three-month period ended December 31,\\n2005 and approximately 9.0 in the nine-month period ended December 31,\\n2005 compared to the three and nine-month periods ended December 31,\\n2004. These sales increases were driven primarily by \\n customer\\ndemand conditions within the Serial EEPROM market, which products comprise\\nsubstantially all of our memory product net sales. \\n\\n18 \\n\\nSerial EEPROM product pricing has\\nhistorically been cyclical in nature, with steep price declines followed by\\nperiods of relative price stability, driven by changes in industry capacity at\\ndifferent stages of the business cycle. We\\nhave experienced, and expect to continue to experience, varying degrees of\\ncompetitive pricing pressures in our Serial EEPROM products. We may be unable to maintain the average\\nselling prices of our Serial EEPROM products as a result of increased pricing\\npressure in the future, which could adversely affect our operating results. \\n\\nAnalog and Interface Products \\n\\nSales of our analog and interface products accounted for\\napproximately 7.4 of our total net sales for the three-month period ended December 31,\\n2005 and 6.8 of our total net sales for the nine-month period ended December 31,\\n2005 compared to approximately 6.0 of our total net sales for the three-month\\nperiod ended December 31, 2004 and approximately 6.8 of our total net\\nsales for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2004. \\n\\nNet sales of our analog and interface products increased approximately\\n39.5 in the three-month period ended December 31, 2005 and approximately 5.6 \\nin the nine-month period ended December 31, 2005 compared to the three and\\nnine-month periods ended December 31, 2004 . These sales increases in our analog and\\ninterface products were driven primarily by supply and demand conditions within\\nthe analog and interface market. \\n\\nAnalog and interface products can be proprietary or\\nnon-proprietary in nature. Currently, we\\nconsider more than half of our analog and interface product mix to be\\nproprietary in nature, where prices are relatively stable, similar to the\\npricing stability experienced in our microcontroller products. The non-proprietary portion of our analog and\\ninterface business will experience price fluctuations, driven primarily by the\\ncurrent supply and demand for those products. \\nWe may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our analog\\nand interface products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future,\\nwhich would adversely affect our operating results. We anticipate the proprietary portion of our\\nanalog and interface products will increase over time. \\n\\nTurns Orders \\n\\nOur net sales in any given quarter\\ndepend upon a combination of shipments from backlog and orders received in that\\nquarter for shipment in that quarter, which we refer to as turns orders. Historically, we have proven our ability to\\nrespond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy, resulting\\nin customers placing orders with short delivery schedules. Shorter lead times generally mean that turns\\norders as a percentage of our business are relatively high in any particular\\nquarter and reduces our backlog visibility on future product shipments. Turns orders correlate to overall\\nsemiconductor industry conditions and product lead times. Turns orders are\\ndifficult to predict, and we may not experience the combination of turns orders\\nand shipments from backlog in a quarter that would be sufficient to achieve\\nanticipated net sales. If we do not\\nachieve a sufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter, our net\\nsales and operating results may suffer. \\n\\nThe foregoing\\nstatements regarding competitive pricing pressure in our microcontroller, Serial\\nEEPROM and analog and interface product lines, our ability to moderate future\\naverage selling price declines in our microcontroller product lines and the\\nproprietary portion of our analog and interface product lines increasing over\\ntime are forward-looking statements. Actual\\nresults could differ materially because of the following factors, among others:\\nthe level of orders that are received and can be shipped in a quarter; changes\\nin demand for our products and the products of our customers; the level and\\ntiming at which previous design wins become actual orders and sales; inventory\\nmix and timing of customer orders; customers inventory levels, order patterns\\nand seasonality; level of sell-through of our products through distribution in\\nany particular fiscal period; our ability to ramp products into volume\\nproduction; competition and competitive pressures on pricing and product\\navailability; disruptions in commercial activities, or international transport\\nor delivery occasioned by terrorist activity, armed conflict, war, natural\\ndisasters or an unexpected increase in the price of, or decrease in the supply\\nof, oil resulting in reduced end-user purchases relative to expectations;\\nimpact of events outside the United States, such as the business impact of fluctuating\\ncurrency rates or unrest or political instability; the cyclical \\n\\n19 \\n\\nnature of both\\nthe semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by our products; market\\nacceptance of our new products and those of our customers; the financial\\ncondition of our customers; fluctuations in production yields, production\\nefficiencies and overall capacity utilization; changes in product mix;\\nabsorption of fixed costs, labor and other fixed manufacturing costs; and\\ngeneral industry, economic and political conditions. \\n\\nDistribution \\n\\nDistributors accounted for approximately 64 of our net sales\\nin the three-month period ended December 31, 2005 and approximately 66 of\\nour net sales in the three-month period ended December 31, 2004. Distributors accounted for approximately 64 \\nof our net sales in the nine-month period ended December 31, 2005 and approximately\\n65 of our net sales in the nine-month period ended December 31, 2004. \\n\\nOur two largest distributors together accounted for\\napproximately 23 of our net sales in the three-month period ended December 31,\\n2005 and approximately 24 of our net sales in the nine-month period ended December 31,\\n2005. Our two largest distributors\\ntogether accounted for approximately 25 of our net sales in the three and nine-month\\nperiods ended December 31, 2004. \\n\\nGenerally, we do not have long-term agreements with our\\ndistributors and we, or our distributors, may terminate our relationships with\\neach other with little or no advanced notice. \\nThe loss of, or the disruption in the operations of, one or more of our\\ndistributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could\\nresult in an increase in inventory returns. \\n\\nAt December 31, 2005, distributors were maintaining an\\naverage of approximately 2.0 months of inventory of our products. Over the past three fiscal years, the months\\nof inventory maintained by our distributors have fluctuated between\\napproximately 2.0 and 2.8 months. Thus,\\ninventory levels at our distributors are at the low end of the range we have\\nexperienced over the last three years. As\\nwe recognize revenue based on sell through for all of our distributors, we do\\nnot believe that inventory holding patterns at our distributors will materially\\nimpact our net sales. \\n\\nThe foregoing\\nstatement regarding our belief that inventory holding patterns at our\\ndistributors will not materially impact our net sales is a forward-looking\\nstatement. Actual results could differ\\nmaterially because of the following factors, among others: the activity level in the overall economy and the uncertainty of\\ncurrent economic and political conditions; changes in demand for our products\\nand the products of our customers; the level and timing at which previous\\ndesign wins become actual orders and sales; inventory mix and timing of\\ncustomer orders; customers inventory levels, order patterns and seasonality;\\nthe impact on our business and customer order patterns due to major public\\nhealth concerns; level of sell-through of our products through distribution in\\nany particular fiscal period; disruptions in commercial activities, or\\ninternational transport or delivery occasioned by terrorist activity, armed\\nconflict, war, natural disasters or an unexpected increase in the price of, or\\ndecrease in the supply of, oil resulting in reduced end-user purchases relative\\nto expectations; impact of events outside the United States, such as the\\nbusiness impact of fluctuating currency rates or unrest or political\\ninstability; the cyclical nature of both the semiconductor industry and the\\nmarkets addressed by our products; market acceptance of our new products and\\nthose of our customers; and the financial condition of our customers. \\n\\nSales\\nby Geography \\n\\nSales by geography for the three and nine-month periods ended\\nDecember 31, 2005 and 2004 were as follows (dollars in thousands): \\n\\n20 \\n\\nThree Months Ended \\n December 31, \\n\\nNine Months Ended \\n December 31, \\n\\n(unaudited) \\n\\n(unaudited) \\n\\n2005 \\n\\n2004 \\n\\n2005 \\n\\n2004 \\n\\nAmericas \\n\\n66,143 \\n\\n28.2 \\n\\n59,723 \\n\\n29.1 \\n\\n194,085 \\n\\n28.5 \\n\\n185,815 \\n\\n29.1 \\n\\nEurope \\n\\n60,105 \\n\\n25.6 \\n\\n52,859 \\n\\n25.7 \\n\\n184,293 \\n\\n27.1 \\n\\n172,477 \\n\\n27.0 \\n\\nAsia \\n\\n108,648 \\n\\n46.2 \\n\\n92,802 \\n\\n45.2 \\n\\n302,343 \\n\\n44.4 \\n\\n280,561 \\n\\n43.9 \\n\\nTotal sales \\n\\n234,896 \\n\\n100.0 \\n\\n205,384 \\n\\n100.0 \\n\\n680,721 \\n\\n100.0 \\n\\n638,853 \\n\\n100.0 \\n\\nOur sales to foreign customers have been predominately in\\nAsia and Europe, which we attribute to the manufacturing strength in those\\nareas for automotive, communications, computing, consumer and industrial\\ncontrol products. Americas sales include\\nsales to customers in the United States, Canada, Central America and South\\nAmerica. \\n\\nSales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 74 of\\nour net sales in three-month period ended December 31, 2005 and\\napproximately 73 of our net sales in the nine-month period ended December 31,\\n2005. Sales to foreign customers accounted\\nfor approximately 73 of our net sales in the three and nine-month periods\\nended December 31, 2004. \\nSubstantially all of our foreign sales are U.S. dollar denominated. \\n\\nGross Profit \\n\\nOur\\ngross profit was 140.3 million in the three months ended December 31, 2005,\\nand 116.8 million in the three months ended December 31, 2004. Our gross profit was 402.3 million in the nine\\nmonths ended December 31, 2005, and 364.6 million in the nine months\\nended December 31, 2004. Gross\\nprofit as a percent of sales was 59.7 in the three months ended December 31,\\n2005, and 56.9 in the three months ended December 31, 2004. Gross profit as a percent of sales was 59.1 \\nin the nine months ended December 31, 2005, and 57.1 in the nine months\\nended December 31, 2004. \\n\\nThe\\nmost significant factors affecting our gross profit percentage in the periods\\ncovered by this report were: \\n\\nimprovements\\nin capacity utilization and absorption of fixed costs which positively affected\\ngross margin by 7.3 million and 15.6 million in the three and nine-month\\nperiods ending December 31, 2005 over the corresponding periods of the\\nprevious fiscal year; and \\n\\n increases\\nin period cost of sales related to depreciation beginning in April 2005 on\\nFab 3, our non-operational facility, which amounted to 1.4 million and 4.2 million\\nin the three and nine-month periods ending December 31, 2005 and 0.8\\nmillion and 2.4 million in the three and nine-month periods ending December 31,\\n2004. \\n\\nOther\\nfactors that impacted gross profit percentage in the periods covered by this\\nreport include: \\n\\ncontinued\\ncost reductions in wafer fabrication and assembly and test manufacturing such\\nas new manufacturing technologies and more efficient manufacturing techniques; \\n\\n varying\\nfactors impacting the average selling prices of our products; \\n\\n fluctuations\\nin the product mix of microcontrollers, proprietary and non-proprietary analog\\nproducts and Serial EEPROM products; and \\n\\n inventory\\nwrite-offs and the sale of inventory that was previously written-off. \\n\\n21 \\n\\nDuring the three-month period ended\\nDecember 31, 2005, we operated at approximately 98 of our Fab 2 capacity,\\nwhich favorably impacted gross margins compared to the same period of the\\nprevious fiscal year. Our utilization of\\nFab 4 s total capacity is at relatively low levels although we are utilizing\\nall of the installed equipment base. We\\nexpect to maintain the capacity utilization at approximately the same levels at\\nFab 2 and Fab 4 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. \\n\\nThe process technologies utilized\\nimpact our gross margins. Fab 2\\ncurrently utilizes various manufacturing process technologies, but\\npredominantly utilizes our 0.5 to 1.0 micron processes. At December 31, 2005, Fab 4 predominantly\\nutilized our 0.5 micron process technology. \\nWe continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies\\nto reduce future manufacturing costs. All\\nof our production has been on 8-inch wafers for the periods covered by this\\nreport. \\n\\nOur overall inventory levels were 114.6 million at December 31,\\n2005 compared to 103.7 million at March 31, 2005. We had 111 days\\nof inventory on our balance sheet at December 31, 2005 compared to 107\\ndays at March 31, 2005 and 101 days at December 31, 2004. \\n\\nWe anticipate that our gross margins will fluctuate over\\ntime, driven primarily by the overall product mix of microcontroller, analog\\nand interface and memory products and the percentage of net sales of each of\\nthese products in a particular quarter, as well as manufacturing yields, fixed\\ncost absorption, capacity utilization levels, particularly those at Fab 4, and\\ncompetitive and economic conditions. \\n\\nThe foregoing\\nstatements relating to our expectation to maintain the current level of\\ncapacity utilization at Fab 2 and Fab 4 during the fourth quarter of fiscal\\n2006, our transition to more advanced process technologies to reduce future\\nmanufacturing costs and the fluctuation of gross margins over time are\\nforward-looking statements. Actual\\nresults could differ materially because of the following factors, among others:\\nchanges in demand for our products and the products of our customers;\\nfluctuations in production yields, production efficiencies and overall capacity\\nutilization; absorption of fixed costs, labor and other direct manufacturing\\ncosts; competition and competitive pressure on pricing; disruptions in\\ncommercial activities, or international transport or delivery occasioned by\\nterrorist activity, armed conflict, war, natural disasters or an unexpected\\nincrease in the price of, or decrease in the supply of, oil resulting in\\nreduced end-user purchases relative to expectations; impact of events outside\\nthe United States, such as the business impact of fluctuating currency rates or\\nunrest or political instability; our ability to increase manufacturing capacity\\nas needed; cost and availability of raw materials; changes in product mix; and\\nother general industry, economic and political conditions. \\n\\nAt December 31, 2005, approximately 62 of our assembly\\nrequirements were being performed in our Thailand facility, compared to\\napproximately 68 as of December 31, 2004. \\nThird-party contractors located in Asia perform the balance of our\\nassembly operations. Substantially all\\nof our test requirements were being performed in our Thailand facility as of December 31,\\n2005 and December 31, 2004. We\\nbelieve that the assembly and test operations performed at our Thailand\\nfacility provide us with significant cost savings when compared to third-party\\ncontractor assembly and test costs, as well as increased control over these\\nportions of the manufacturing process. \\n\\nWe rely on outside wafer foundries\\nfor a small portion of our wafer fabrication requirements. \\n\\nOur use of third parties involves some reduction in our level\\nof control over the portions of our business that we subcontract. While we review the quality, delivery and\\ncost performance of our third-party contractors, our future operating results\\ncould suffer if any third-party contractor is unable to maintain manufacturing\\nyields, assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current\\nlevels. \\n\\nResearch\\nand Development (R D) \\n\\nR D\\nexpenses for the three months ended December 31, 2005 were 23.4 million,\\nor 10.0 of sales, compared to 23.1 million, or 11.2 of sales, for the three\\nmonths ended December 31, 2004. R D\\nexpenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2005 were 70.4 million,\\nor 10.3 of sales, compared to 69.7 million, or \\n\\n22 \\n\\n10.9 of sales for the nine\\nmonths ended December 31, 2004. We\\nare committed to investing in new and enhanced products, including development\\nsystems software, and in our design and manufacturing process technologies. We believe these investments are significant\\nfactors in maintaining our competitive position. We expense all R D costs as incurred. R D expenses include labor, depreciation,\\nmasks, prototype wafers, and expenses for the development of process\\ntechnologies, new packages, and software to support new products and design\\nenvironments. \\n\\nSelling,\\nGeneral and Administrative \\n\\nSelling,\\ngeneral and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31,\\n2005 were 32.3 million, or 13.7 of sales,\\ncompared to 28.1 million, or 13.7 of sales, for the three months ended December 31,\\n2004. Selling, general and\\nadministrative expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2005 were 95.0 million, or 14.0 of sales, compared to 83.3 million, or 13.1 \\nof sales, for the nine months ended December 31, 2004. Selling, general and administrative expenses\\ninclude salary expenses related to field sales, marketing and administrative\\npersonnel, advertising and promotional expenditures and legal expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses\\nalso include costs related to our direct sales force and field applications\\nengineers who work in sales offices worldwide to stimulate demand by assisting\\ncustomers in the selection and use of our products. \\n\\nSelling,\\ngeneral and administrative expenses increased 4.2 million, or 15.1 , for the three months ended December 31,\\n2005 over the same period last year. Selling,\\ngeneral and administrative expenses increased 11.7 million, or 14.1 , for\\nthe nine months ended December 31, 2005 over the same period last\\nyear. The primary reasons for the increases\\nin selling, general and administrative expenses in these periods was higher\\nlabor costs as a result of expanding our internal resources involved in the\\ntechnical aspect of selling our products. \\n\\nSelling,\\ngeneral and administrative expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to\\nrevenue and operating expense levels. \\n\\nSpecial Charges \\n\\nIn fiscal 2005 we reached an agreement with U.S. Philips\\nCorporation and Philips Electronics North America Corp. (together Philips regarding patent license\\nlitigation between Philips and ourselves which had been ongoing since October 2001. The agreement included dismissal of the then\\npending litigation and the cross-license of certain patents between Philips and\\nMicrochip. We recorded a special charge\\nof 21.1 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2004 associated with this\\nmatter. As part of the settlement, we\\nlicensed certain of our patents related to 8-pin microcontrollers to Philips,\\nand Philips licensed its patents related to I 2 C serial\\ncommunications to us, each on fully-paid up, non-royalty bearing worldwide\\nlicenses. The definitive agreement\\nrelated to this matter was finalized and executed and the cash payment was made\\nby us to Philips during our fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2004. \\n\\nOther\\nIncome (Expense) \\n\\nInterest income in the three and nine-month periods\\nended December 31, 2005 increased from interest income in the three and nine-month\\nperiods ended December 31, 2004 as our average invested cash balances and\\nthe average interest rates on those invested cash balances were at higher\\nlevels in the periods ended December 31, 2005 compared to the same periods\\nin the last fiscal year. \\n\\nProvision for Income\\nTaxes \\n\\nProvisions\\nfor income taxes reflect tax on foreign earnings and federal and state tax on\\nU.S. earnings. We had an effective tax\\nrate of 35.8 for the nine months ended December 31, 2005, including a 30.6\\nmillion tax expense related to a 500 million repatriation under the American\\nJobs Creation Act (the Jobs Act in the third quarter of fiscal 2006. The Jobs Act, enacted on October 22,\\n2004, provides for a temporary deduction of 85 of dividends received on\\ncertain foreign earnings repatriated during a one-year period. The maximum amount of foreign earnings that\\nqualify for the temporary deduction is 500 million and would need to be\\ndistributed prior to \\n\\n23 \\n\\nthe end of fiscal\\n2006. On February 4, 2006, the\\nCompany decided to take advantage of this temporary incentive and intends to\\nrepatriate the maximum permitted amount of 500 million in foreign earnings\\npursuant to the Jobs Act. The repatriation will be effected by the payment of a dividend by a\\ncontrolled foreign corporation to the Company. \\nThe declaration and payment of such dividend is expected to made in the\\nfourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Additionally,\\nwe plan to pursue a ruling from a government taxing authority which could\\nreduce the tax expense from the repatriation by up to approximately 6.0\\nmillion. If a favorable ruling is received\\non this matter, we would reduce our tax expense in the period the ruling is\\nreceived. The submission for the tax\\nruling will be done prior to any dividend declaration being made for the\\nrepatriation from our foreign subsidiaries. This action represents a change in our\\nintended use of the foreign earnings being repatriated to no longer be\\nconsidered permanently invested offshore. \\nManagement intends to have the remainder of our foreign earnings\\ncontinue to be permanently invested offshore. \\nWe had an effective tax rate of 22.5 for the nine months ended December 31,\\n2004, including the tax effects from the 21.1 million special charge related\\nto the Philips settlement which was tax effected at our applicable U.S. federal\\nand state tax rate of 38.5 . See Note 10 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for\\nadditional information on our effective tax rates. \\n\\nAt December 31,\\n2005, our gross deferred tax asset was 62.7 million. Our gross deferred tax asset decreased by 42.4 million\\nin the nine months ended December 31, 2005 compared to the level at March 31,\\n2005, due primarily to increases in income, the repatriation under the Jobs Act,\\nwhich allowed us to utilize tax credits, and changes in various temporary\\ndifferences between our book and tax reporting. \\nAt December 31, 2005, our deferred tax liability was 19.0 million. Our gross deferred tax liability decreased by\\n 5.5 million in the nine months ended December 31, 2005 compared to the\\nlevel at March 31, 2005, due primarily to changes in temporary differences\\nin depreciation between our book and tax reporting. \\n\\nOur Thailand manufacturing operations currently\\nbenefit from numerous tax holidays that have been granted to us by the Thailand\\ngovernment based on our investments in property, plant and equipment in\\nThailand. Our tax holiday periods in\\nThailand expire at various times beginning in September 2006. We do not expect the future expiration of any\\nof our tax holiday periods in Thailand to have a material impact on our\\neffective tax rate. Any expiration of\\ntax holidays are expected to have a minimal impact on our overall tax expense\\ndue to other tax holidays and an increase in income in other taxing\\njurisdictions with lower statutory rates. \\n\\nThe foregoing statements regarding the expected timing of the dividend\\ndeclaration and payment; pursuing a ruling from a taxing authority, the\\npossible up to 6.0 million in reduced tax expense, our intent to have the\\nremainder of our foreign earnings invested offshore and the impact of expiring\\ntax holidays being offset by other tax holidays are forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially\\nbecause of the following factors, among others: actual cash flows\\ngenerated from and used in the operation of our business; the outcome of the ruling\\nfrom the taxing authority; actual or projected levels of capital expenditures;\\nour balance of cash and cash equivalents;\\ngeneral economic, industry or political conditions in the United States or\\ninternationally; current\\nand future tax laws and regulations; taxation rates in geographic regions where\\nwe have significant operations; results of any current or future audit\\nconducted by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities in\\nthe countries in which we do business; the level of our taxable income; and whether\\nour taxable income will be sufficient to utilize our deferred tax asset. \\n\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \\n\\nWe had 992.4 million in\\ncash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at December 31, 2005, an\\nincrease of 257.7 million from the March 31, 2005 balance. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and\\nshort-term investments over this time period is primarily attributable to cash\\ngenerated from operating activities. \\n\\nWe\\nmaintain an unsecured short-term line of credit with various financial\\ninstitutions in Asia totaling 5.0 million (U.S. dollar equivalent). There were no borrowings under the foreign\\nline of credit as of December 31, 2005, but an allocation of approximately\\n 0.7 million of the available line was made, relating to import guarantees\\nassociated with our business in Thailand. \\nThere are no covenants related to the foreign line of credit. \\n\\nNet\\ncash provided from operating activities was 323.1 million for the nine-month\\nperiod ended December 31, 2005 compared to 295.4 million for the nine-month\\nperiod ended December 31, 2004. The\\nincrease in cash flow \\n\\n24 \\n\\nfrom operations was\\nprimarily from increases in profitability and increases in accounts payable and\\naccrued liability balances, which were offset by increases in inventory and changes\\nin deferred income on shipments to distributors. \\n\\nDuring\\nthe nine months ended December 31, 2005, net cash used in investing\\nactivities decreased 94.6 million,\\nto 214.9 million, from 309.5 million for the nine months ended December 31,\\n2004. The decrease was due primarily to\\nchanges in our net purchases, sales and maturities of short-term investments and\\ndecreases in capital expenditures in the nine months ended December 31,\\n2005. \\n\\nWe\\nenter into hedging transactions from time to time in an attempt to minimize our\\nexposure to currency rate fluctuations. The\\namount of the hedges outstanding at December 31, 2005 were immaterial. Although none of the countries in which we\\nconduct significant foreign operations have had a highly inflationary economy\\nin the last five years, there is no assurance that inflation rates or\\nfluctuations in foreign currency rates in countries where we conduct operations\\nwill not adversely affect our operating results in the future. \\n\\nOur\\nlevel of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual\\nand anticipated business conditions. Capital\\nexpenditures in the nine months ended December 31, 2005 were 42.8 million\\ncompared to 55.3 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2004. Capital expenditures are primarily for the\\nexpansion of production capacity and the addition of research and development\\nequipment. We currently anticipate\\nspending approximately 70 million during the next 12 months to invest in\\nequipment and facilities to maintain, and selectively increase, capacity to\\nmeet our currently anticipated needs. \\n\\nWe\\nexpect to finance capital expenditures through our existing cash balances and\\ncash flows from operations. We believe\\nthat the capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next 12\\nmonths will provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our currently\\nanticipated needs. \\n\\nNet cash used in\\nfinancing activities was 19.4 million for the nine months ended December 31,\\n2005 compared to 15.1 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2004. Proceeds from the exercise of stock options\\nand employee purchases under our employee stock purchase plan were 63.5 million\\nfor the nine months ended December 31, 2005 and 36.2 million for the nine\\nmonths ended December 31, 2004. Cash\\nexpended for the repurchase of our common stock was 3.3 million in the nine\\nmonths ended December 31, 2005 and 67.1 million in the nine months\\nended December 31, 2004. We paid\\ncash dividends to our shareholders of 79.6 million in the nine months\\nended December 31, 2005 and 28.5 million\\nin the nine months ended December 31, 2004. Proceeds from short-term borrowings were 44.3 million\\nin the nine months ended December 31, 2004. \\n\\nOn April 22, 2004, our Board of Directors\\nauthorized the repurchase of 2.5 million shares of our common stock in the open\\nmarket or in privately negotiated transactions. \\nAs of December 31, 2005, we had repurchased 1,004,834 common shares\\nunder this authorization for a total of 26.6 million. During the three and nine months ended December 31,\\n2005, we purchased 119,934 shares for 3.3 million. As of December 31, 2005, all of the\\npurchased shares under the authorization were used to fund stock option\\nexercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan. The timing and amount of any future\\nrepurchases will depend upon market conditions and corporate considerations. \\n\\nOn October 28,\\n2002, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved and instituted a\\nquarterly cash dividend on our common stock. \\nThe initial quarterly dividend of 0.02 per share was paid on December 6,\\n2003 in the aggregate amount of 4.0 million. We have continued to pay quarterly dividends\\nand have increased the amount of such dividends on a regular basis. A quarterly dividend of 0.16 per share was\\npaid on November 18, 2005 in the aggregate amount of 33.6 million. A quarterly dividend of 0.19 per share was\\ndeclared on January 19, 2006 and will be paid on February 16, 2006 to\\nshareholders of record as of February 2, 2006. We expect the February 2006 cash\\ndividend to be approximately 40.0 million. \\nDuring the first nine months of fiscal 2006, we paid dividends in the\\namount of 0.38 per share for a total dividend payment of 79.6 million. During fiscal 2005, we paid dividends in the aggregate\\namount of 0.208 per share for a total dividend\\npayment of 43.0 million. Since the\\ninception of our dividend program, we have paid aggregate dividends of 154.1\\nmillion. \\n\\n25 \\n\\nWe\\nbelieve that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated\\nfrom operations will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated cash\\nrequirements for at least the next 12 months. \\nHowever, the semiconductor industry is capital intensive. In order to remain competitive, we must\\nconstantly evaluate the need to make significant investments in capital\\nequipment for both production and research and development. We may seek additional equity or debt financing\\nfrom time to time to maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product\\nassembly and test facilities, or for other purposes. The timing and amount of any such financing\\nrequirements will depend on a number of factors, including demand for our\\nproducts, changes in industry conditions, product mix, and competitive factors. There can be no assurance that such financing\\nwill be available on acceptable terms, and any additional equity financing\\nwould result in incremental ownership dilution to our existing stockholders. \\n\\nThe foregoing statements regarding our anticipated\\nlevel of capital expenditures over the next 12 months, the nature of such\\nexpenditures, the financing and sufficiency of our capital expenditures, our\\nbelief that existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our\\nrequirements and our anticipated payment of cash dividends are forward-looking\\nstatements. Actual results could differ\\nmaterially because of the following factors, among others: changes in demand\\nfor our products and those of our customers; changes in utilization of current\\nmanufacturing capacity; unanticipated costs in continuing to ramp production at\\nFab 4; market acceptance of our products and of our customers products; the\\ncyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by our\\nproducts; the availability and cost of raw materials, equipment and other\\nsupplies; actual levels of capital expenditures; the costs and outcome of any\\ntax audit or any litigation involving intellectual property, customers or other\\nissues; the financial condition of our customers and vendors; uninsured losses;\\nand the economic, political and other conditions in the worldwide markets\\nserved by us. \\n\\nContractual\\nObligations \\n\\nThere have not\\nbeen any material changes in our contractual obligations from what we disclosed\\nin our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2005. \\n\\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \\n\\nAs of December 31, 2005, we are not involved in\\nany off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 3(a)(4)(ii) of SEC\\nRegulation S-K. \\n\\nRecently\\nIssued Accounting Pronouncements \\n\\nDuring December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R\\nwhich requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all\\nshare-based payments at fair value. Share-based\\npayments include stock option grants. We\\ngrant options to purchase common stock to our employees and directors under our\\nstock option plan at prices equal to the market value of the stock on the dates\\nthe options were granted. SFAS No. 123R\\nis effective for us beginning April 1, 2006. Early adoption of the provisions of SFAS No. 123R\\nis encouraged, but not required. We have\\nnot yet adopted this pronouncement and are currently evaluating the expected\\nimpact that the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will have on our consolidated\\nfinancial position and results of operations. \\nWe expect the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will have an unfavorable\\nimpact on our consolidated results of operations and net income per common\\nshare. SFAS No. 123R also requires\\nthe benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be\\nreported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as\\nrequired under current guidelines. This\\nrequirement will reduce our net operating cash flows and increase our net financing\\ncash flows in periods after adoption. We\\ncannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend\\non, among other things, the form of equity compensation, the number of grants\\nand when employees exercise stock options. \\n\\nFASB Staff Position FSP No. 109-2, Accounting\\nand Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within\\nthe American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 FSP 109-2 ), provides guidance under\\nFASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, SFAS 109 with\\nrespect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the\\nAmerican Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Jobs Act on enterprises \\n\\n26 \\n\\nincome\\ntax expense and deferred tax liability. The\\nJobs Creation Act was enacted on October 22, 2004. FSP 109-2 states that an enterprise is\\nallowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the\\neffect of the Jobs Act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign\\nearnings for purposes of applying SFAS 109. \\nOn February 4, 2006, the Company decided to take advantage of the\\nprovisions of the Jobs Act and plans to repatriate the maximum permitted amount\\nof 500 million in foreign earnings in accordance with the provisions of the\\nJobs Act. In the quarter ended December 31,\\n2005, we adjusted our tax expense, deferred tax assets and current income tax\\nliability to reflect the repatriation provisions of the Jobs Act. The Jobs Act also provides a deduction for\\nincome from qualified domestic production activities, to be phased in from 2005\\nthrough 2010, which is intended to replace the existing extra-territorial\\nincome exclusion for foreign sales. In\\nFSP 109-1, the FASB decided the deduction for qualified domestic production\\nactivities should be accounted for as a special deduction under SFAS 109,\\nrather than as a rate reduction. Accordingly,\\nany benefit from the deduction will be reported in the period in which the\\ndeduction is claimed on the tax return and no adjustment to deferred taxes at December 31,\\n2005 is required. \\n\\nIn November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 115-1\\nand FAS 124-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its\\nApplication to Certain Investments FSP 115-1 ), which provides guidance on\\ndetermining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are\\nconsidered impaired, whether that impairment is other-than-temporary, and on\\nmeasuring such impairment loss. FSP 115-1\\nalso includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an\\nother-than-temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about\\nunrealized losses that have not been recognized as other-than-temporary\\nimpairments. FSP 115-1 is required to be applied to reporting periods beginning\\nafter December 15, 2005 and is required to be adopted by us in the fourth\\nquarter of fiscal 2006. We are currently\\nevaluating the effect that the adoption of FSP 115-1 will have on our\\nconsolidated results of operations and financial condition but we do not expect\\nit to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial\\ncondition. \\n\\nIn\\nDecember 2004, the FASB also issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs,\\nan amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, SFAS 151 which became\\neffective for us beginning January 1, 2006. This standard clarifies that abnormal amounts\\nof idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material should be\\nexpensed as incurred and not included in overhead. In addition, this standard requires that the\\nallocation of fixed production overhead costs to inventory be based on the\\nnormal capacity of the production facilities. \\nWe are currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard on our\\nfinancial position and results of operations, but do not believe the impact of\\nthe change will be material.', 27965.0, '595017104', 2006, 26984, 64486)\n"
